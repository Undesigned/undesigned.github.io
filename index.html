<h1>Design consulting without the bullshit.</h1>
<h2>1 page, 7 days, $1500. It's that simple.</h2>

<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>

<p><span class="highlight">Design is the process of solving problems,</span> not just making things look pretty. Design thinking is critical to the success of any startup.</p>

<p>We're a new kind of design consultancy. Rather than work on large projects where budget and scope can balloon out of control, our goal is to help startups quickly improve their business. We understand startups, and strive to minimize risk, cost, time, and headaches for you. That's why we work on one page of your site or app in just one week at a fixed low rate. You know exactly what you're getting, when you'll get it, and for how much, without any surprises or tedious negotiation.</p>

<h3>OUR PHILOSOPHIES</h3>

<ol id="philosophies">
  <li>
    <h4>Date, don't marry.</h4>
    <p>You wouldn't marry a stranger, so why sign a risky long-term contract with a random design consultancy? Take us on a date, and <span class="highlight">see what we can do for you in 7 days.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>KISS.</h4>
    <p>Keep It Simple, Stupid. <span class="highlight">We <em>hate</em> complexity and will ruthlessly cut it out</span> wherever we can. You can see this in our business model, our designs, and our interactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Be more than a pretty face.</h4>
    <p>Good design is invisible. It doesn't "wow," it makes customers say "of course." In fact, <span class="highlight">the best designs almost seem <em>undesigned</em>.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Love trumps all.</h4>
    <p>We are passionate about our work and aren't happy until we've made something that customers love. Love is a strong emotion, but so is passion.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>

<p>Our team has consulted for everything from Fortune 500 companies, like PepsiCo and Microsoft, to one-person startups. We are all founders of profitable startups, so we understand your problems because <span class="highlight">we're in the trenches with you.</span> But most importantly, weâ€™re passionate about startups and design, and want to help you kick ass.</p>
