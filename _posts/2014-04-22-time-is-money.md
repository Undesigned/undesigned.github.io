title: Time is Money

A few years ago, I met a non-technical entrepreneur who had an idea for a technical startup. Like many solo non-technical founders, he decided to outsource the work to a development firm, who happily took the job. They quoted him $25,000 for a project to be completed in three months. When I met him, it had already been six months and he had spent over $60,000, with no end in sight. He wanted out, but he had already sunk so much time and money that he didn't want to just abandon the project.

Sadly, this horror story isn't unique or rare. Nobody is ever happy about entering into a situation that could end up like that, but such a risk can be especially deadly for a startup.

We started [Undesigned](http://www.undesigned.io) because we want to help startups and small businesses avoid that risk. That's why we set hard limits on our timeline and transparently display our flat-rate price so there's no confusion.

Most startups fail because they run out of money. There are 2 ways to avoid running out of money: spend less and earn more. Spending less is obvious, but in order to earn any money, you need a product first. That means for early stage startups, the single most important thing is launching your product as fast as possible. After you launch, your focus becomes quickly iterating based on user feedback to find the perfect product-market fit.

In order to move fast, you have to boil your initial idea down to a minimum viable product (MVP). Think of this like a proof of concept or prototype to validate your idea. If customers like it and use it, then you can dedicate more resources to iteratively improving it. If your product takes six months to build, it's way too large for a first release. An easy way to prevent feature bloat or wasted time is to place limits on yourself.

For example, the first iteration of Undesigned's site assumed there would be a contact page where our potential customers would go to reach us. However, we had limited ourselves to building a one-page site, so we were forced to nix the contact page. This resulted in us directly placing our email address and phone number on our home page, which is a much simpler experience for our customers than the typical contact form. It also saved us from designing a second page, which would have doubled our launch time.

To recap, artificial limitations keep your MVP in check. A lean MVP keeps your development time in check. Quick development time keeps your budget small. A small budget keeps your startup alive.

So what are you waiting for? Ship your MVP! And if you need help, don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:hello@undesigned.io) :)
